# data-science-projects
A collection of projects I have worked on (or am working on) during my studies of data science. Serveral of these projects were completed as part of the Data Science career path on Codecademy that I finished May 2023. The intention of these projects is to show the range of I what I studied and to have all the projects in one place for me to refer back to as necessary. Finally, I intend to add independent projects as I continue to study and hopefully deepen my knowledge of the many aspects of data science and it related fields.
